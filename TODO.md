# TODO for Enhancing Dynamic Posture Outlines in CameraTestScreen

- [ ] Refactor `renderExerciseGuide` in `CameraTestScreen.tsx` to add test-specific dynamic outlines with distinct colors and styles.
- [ ] Integrate Hugging Face pose model output to improve keypoint accuracy and overlay alignment.
- [ ] Add more detailed overlays for each test type (pushups, balance, etc.) matching the example image style.
- [ ] Create or update React Native components for complex outlines if needed.
- [ ] Ensure overlays update in real-time with live video feed.
- [ ] Test overlays on device/emulator for visual clarity and performance.
- [ ] Optimize styles and animations for smooth rendering.
- [ ] Document changes and update comments in code.

Next Steps:
- Start by updating pose keypoint processing to use Hugging Face model.
- Enhance overlay rendering logic for test-specific outlines.
- Test and iterate.
